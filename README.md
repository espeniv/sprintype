# Sprintype
This web application challenges users to improve their typing speed
through a fast-paced word game. Players have 30 seconds to type as
many falling words as possible, to earn points and compete for a
spot on the leaderboard. High scores are stored and retrieved using
a connected database, adding a persistent competitive element. The
project was developed to strengthen my skills with TypeScript and
React.
